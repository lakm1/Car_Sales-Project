# Car Sales Project ðŸ“Š

Data science and machine learning project built as part of the **Tuwaiq Academy â€“ Week Two Bootcamp Project**.  
The project focuses on analyzing a car sales dataset, cleaning and exploring data, and building predictive models to estimate car prices.  
A **Streamlit app** with machine learning integration allows users to interactively predict car prices based on input features.

##  Project Overview

- Exploring real-world car sales data (cleaning, handling outliers).  
- Performing EDA with visualizations to uncover sales patterns and insights.  
- Building machine learning models for price prediction.  
- Deploying an interactive dashboard using Streamlit.  
- Delivering results in a clear and practical interface.

## How to Run
1. Clone Repository
   ``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/lakm1/Car_Sales-Project.git
   cd Car_Sales-Project
   ```
2. Install Requirements
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run Streamlit Dashboard
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
## Project Outcomes

Cleaned dataset improved prediction accuracy by removing outliers.

Key factors affecting car prices: brand, year, mileage, and engine size.

Dashboard enables real-time car price predictions for different scenarios.
